# Top Mortality Causes of South Korea

## Overview

This repository looks into top mortality causes of South Korea. There are various causes of deaths that are prevalent and yet we do not really care about it in our daily lives. It is crucial to note the top causes of mortality not just for governments or healthcare but also so that we citizens can work together to decrease annual number of deaths for causes that can be prevented. This paper will dive into the top mortality causes of the Republic of Korea so that we can create poisson and negative binomial models to predict which causes will have an increase or decrease in the number of annual deaths when all other conditions are kept the same. Then, using the models results and research we will analyze in depth about the top causes of deaths in South Korea
