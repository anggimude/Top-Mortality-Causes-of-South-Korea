It looks like you are trying to create a vector year with specific values in R. To modify the code in RStudio as per your requirements, you can use the c() function to concatenate the desired values. Here's the modified code:

R
Copy code
year <- c(2000, 2010, 2015, 2019)
This code creates a vector named year with the values 2000, 2010, 2015, and 2019. You can run this code in RStudio to initialize the year vector with the specified values.
